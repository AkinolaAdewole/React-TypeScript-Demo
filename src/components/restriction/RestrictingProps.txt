In React TypeScript, you can restrict the allowed props for a component by using TypeScript's type annotations and interfaces.
By defining the prop types, you can ensure that the component only receives the expected props and prevent potential errors caused by incorrect usage.

Here's an example of how to restrict props in a React TypeScript component:

import React from 'react';

type MyComponentProps {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isStudent: boolean;
}

const MyComponent = ({ name, age, isStudent }:MyComponentProps) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {name}</p>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
      <p>Is Student: {isStudent ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;





In the example above, we define an interface MyComponentProps that describes the expected prop types for the MyComponent component. 
It includes name of type string, age of type number, and isStudent of type boolean.

The MyComponent component is then annotated with { name, age, isStudent }:MyComponentProps , specifying that it expects props of type MyComponentProps. 
Within the component, we can destructure the props object to access the individual prop values (name, age, isStudent).

By using this approach, TypeScript will enforce that the component is called with the required props and with the correct types. 
If you try to pass props that don't match the defined types, TypeScript will show a compilation error.

This type-checking mechanism helps catch potential bugs during development and provides better documentation for the component's usage. 
It also makes it easier for other developers to understand and use your component correctly.

Note: It's important to ensure that the prop types defined in the interface align with how the component is used and the expected prop values.
