In React TypeScript, the useRef hook is used to create a mutable reference that persists across renders of a functional component. 
It allows you to access and modify a value that persists between different renders without triggering a re-render.

In React TypeScript, you can use RefObject(useRef) from the react package to create a reference to a DOM element. 
RefObject(useRef) allows you to access and manipulate the underlying DOM element directly.

In React TypeScript, a mutable ref can be created using the useRef hook. 
A mutable ref allows you to store a value that can be modified without causing a re-render of the component.

DOM Refs (Ref forwarding):
DOM refs, also known as "ref forwarding," are primarily used to reference and interact with DOM elements directly. 
They are created using the createRef() function or the useRef() hook. DOM refs allow you to access properties and methods of DOM elements, 
such as inputRef.current.value or inputRef.current.focus(). 
DOM refs are typically used when you need direct access to a specific DOM element or to integrate with third-party libraries that require DOM manipulation.

Mutable Refs:
Mutable refs, created using the useRef() hook, are more general-purpose and can be used to store any mutable value or reference. 
Mutable refs are not limited to DOM elements and can hold any JavaScript value, including objects, arrays, or other mutable values. 
They persist across component renders and can be updated without causing a re-render of the component.

Overall, DOM refs are specifically used for interacting with DOM elements, while mutable refs are more flexible and can hold any mutable value. 
Choose the appropriate type of ref based on your specific use case and the nature of the value or element you need to reference.
