In React TypeScript, you can create a polymorphic component by using generics. 
Generics allow you to define a component that can accept different types as props, enabling you to create reusable and flexible components.

In React TypeScript, a polymorphic component refers to a component that can accept different types of props and render content based on those props. 
This pattern allows you to reuse a single component for multiple scenarios while maintaining type safety.

To create a polymorphic component, you can use TypeScript's generic types to define the prop types dynamically.

Finally, we use the PolymorphicComponent with different types of data (string, number, and an object). 
TypeScript will infer the appropriate type for each usage, ensuring type safety throughout your application.

Polymorphic components are a powerful concept in React TypeScript, enabling code reuse and type safety simultaneously. 
They are particularly useful when you want to build reusable components that can be used with various data types.
